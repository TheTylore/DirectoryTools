# DirectoryTools

## Attention to anyone viewing
This project died nearly a month after I started it. I have recently begun reviewing what little work I had done and will potentially be working on it in the future.
Currently the only script "worthy" of viewing is removeNumbers.py

## Description:
A repo for testing out Python scripts that are QoL improvements for when I clone/download large directories.
